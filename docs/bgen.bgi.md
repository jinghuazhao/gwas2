# bgen.bgi

bgen.bgi is the index file created using command such as `bgenix -g chr9.bgen -index`.

The utilities [bgi.sql](bgi.sql), [bgi.R](bgi.R) and [bgi.py](bgi.py) here modify the index file in order to be picked up by software such as SAIGE.

The driver program [setup.sh](setup.sh) includes calls to the utilities.
